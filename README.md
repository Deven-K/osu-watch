# Deven Kelsey Individual Project
This repository will contain my project for Madison College's Enterprise Java class.

### Problem Statement
I would like to be good at video games, unfortunately, I am not. But as always, a good way to get better is to practice, and even better is good practice. However, good practice takes focus, thought and planning. These are also skills I know I, and many others are lacking in. I think the best way to get that focus, is to make a focused application, so I have picked a single game to make a tool to improve in. That choice for me is [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh), a free-to-play online rhythm game. I would like to build a web app that tracks your progress along goals you set on various elements of the game, with a messaging bot to inform you of your progress and encourage you along the way.
